## Acknowledgements
A great deal of code was borrowed from [Brandon Jorgenson's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-jorgenson/) similar [Rate My Professor Extension for BYU](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rate-my-byu-professors/ghokpcnkghnkfofadiajmmhinooijmaf). The code uses the [Tooltipster JQuery Plugin](https://plugins.jquery.com/tooltipster/) to create the popups. Thank you to Patrick Spinler for his unending patience, kindness, and mentorship.
